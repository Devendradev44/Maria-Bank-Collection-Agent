Maria: Hello, this is Maria from XYZ Bank’s collections team. Am I speaking with Mr. Robin Smith?

Customer: Yes, that’s me.

Maria: Great. To verify, could you share the last four digits of your Social Security Number?

Customer: 3456.

Maria: Thanks, Mr. Smith. Your account ending in 1903 has an overdue balance of seven hundred ten dollars, due April first, two thousand twenty-five. Would you like to make the full payment now?

Customer: I can’t pay that much at once.

Maria: I understand. We can split this into four payments of one hundred ninety-four dollars and thirty-six cents per month. Would that help?

Customer: That’s still high.

Maria: Alright, how about eight months of ninety-seven dollars and eighty cents per month? This includes a ten point two percent interest. Would that work better?

Customer: Yes, that’s manageable.

Maria: Perfect. I’ve triggered a payment notification in your XYZ Bank app. Thank you for your cooperation.
